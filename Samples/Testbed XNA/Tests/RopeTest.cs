    /// excessive stretching and has no other effect.
    /// By disabling the rope joint you can see that the Box2D solver has trouble
    /// supporting heavy bodies with light bodies. Try playing around with the
    /// densities, time step, and iterations to see how they affect stability.
    /// This test also shows how to use contact filtering. Filtering is configured
