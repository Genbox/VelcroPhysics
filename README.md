# Welcome to Velcro Physics

## What is this?
Velcro Physics is a high performance 2D collision detection system with realistic physics responses.

## What is it good for?
You can create a game, robotic simulatons or even UI feedback systems using this engine and associated tools. Everything from a simple platform game to Marsrover simulations are possible.

## Features
We have tons of features!

* Continuous collision detection (with time of impact solver)
* Contact callbacks: begin, end, pre-solve, post-solve
* Convex and concave polyons and circles.
* Multiple shapes per body
* Dynamic tree and quad tree broadphase
* Fast broadphase AABB queries and raycasts
* Collision groups and categories
* Sleep management
* Friction and restitution
* Stable stacking with a linear-time solver
* Revolute, prismatic, distance, pulley, gear, mouse joint, and other joint types
* Joint limits and joint motors
* Controllers (gravity, force generators)
* Tools to decompose concave polygons, find convex hulls and boolean operations
* Factories to simplify the creation of bodies
